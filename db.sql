Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost. As Instance Store based volumes provide high random I/O performance at low cost (as the storage is part of the instance's usage cost) and the resilient architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance, therefore you should use Instance Store based EC2 instances for this use-case."

CloudFront uses standard cache control headers you set on your files to identify static and dynamic content. You can use different origins for different types of content on a single site - e.g. S3 for static objects, EC2 for dynamic content, and custom origins for third-party content. An origin server stores the original, definitive version of your objects. If you're serving content over HTTP, your origin server is either an S3 bucket or an HTTP server, such as a web server. Your HTTP server can run on an EC2 instance or on a server that you manage, these servers are also known as custom origins."

"Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you're already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. So, ingest the data in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and use a AWS Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming data before the output is dumped on S3. This way you only need to store a sliced version of the data with only the relevant data attributes required for your model. Also it should be noted that this solution is entirely serveless and requires no infrastructure maintenance."

Given this scenario, which of the following is correct regarding the charges for this image transfer?",

"There are no S3 data transfer charges when data is transferred in from the internet. Also with S3TA, you pay only for transfer that are accelerated.

The company is looking for AWS services that can be used for buffering or throttling to handle such traffic variations. Which of the following services can be used to support this requirement?",
"Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis.",
"",
"Throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests an authorized program can submit to a given operation in a given amount of time. To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size. SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serveless applications. SQS offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency. Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed, scalable service that can ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real time."

"Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.",

"RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB instance, RDS automatically creates a primary DB instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones (AZs) within a single region. RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchrounous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance. Read replicas can be within an Availability Zone (AZ), Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region."
