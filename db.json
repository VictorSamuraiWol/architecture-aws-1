The company runs a clone of the same application in the dev environment for up to 8 hours every day. The company wants to build the MOST cost-optimal solution by deploying these applications using the best-fit pricing options for EC2 instances. What would you recommend?",

You can use on-demand instances for the dev application since it is only used for up to 8 hours per day. On-demand offers the flexibility to only pay for the Amazon EC2 instance when it is being used (0 to 8 hours for the given use case)."

Implement standard HTTP methos such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Also, Amazon API Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that: adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server. Route incoming messages based on message content. So Amazon API Gateway supports stateless RESTful APIs as well as stateful WebSocket APIs."

The development team expects a peak rate of about 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS. It is important that the messages are processed in order. Which option can be used to implement this system?",
            "answer": "SQS FIFO (Fist-In-Fist-Out) queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate.",

            "descriptionP": "By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second). When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 messages per second. Therefore you need to process 4 messages per operations so that the FIFO queue can support up to 1200 messages per second, which is well within the peak rate."

When the new AMI is copied from Region A into Region B, it automatically creates a snapshot in Region B because AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots. Further, an instance is created from this AMI in Region B. Hence, we have 1 EC2, 1AMI and 1 snapshot in Region B."
