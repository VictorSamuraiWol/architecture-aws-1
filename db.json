Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost. As Instance Store based volumes provide high random I/O performance at low cost (as the storage is part of the instance's usage cost) and the resilient architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance, therefore you should use Instance Store based EC2 instances for this use-case."

An origin server stores the original, definitive version of your objects. If you're serving content over HTTP, your origin server is either an S3 bucket or an HTTP server, such as a web server.

It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. So, ingest the data in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and use a AWS Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming data before the output is dumped on S3. This way you only need to store a sliced version of the data with only the relevant data attributes required for your model.

To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size. SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serveless applications. SQS offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency.

They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.
